Router package initialization
Import and expose all routers for easy inclusion in main.py
"""

# This file allows you to import all routers at once
# You'll create these files as you migrate functionality:

# from .auth import router as auth
# from .profile import router as profile
# from .supplies import router as supplies
# from .equipment import router as equipment
# from .forecast import router as forecast
# from .logs import router as logs
# from .accounts import router as accounts
# from .export import router as export
# from .bulk_import import router as bulk_import

# For now, leave empty and import directly in main.py
